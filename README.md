# heart-disease-ml-project

## Given clinical parameters about patient, to predict the given patient is affected with heart-disease or not heart-disease ?
## Dataset
    The Data of Cleveland database is taken from the Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
    age -> in years
    sex -> (1 = male; 0 = female)
    cp -> chest pain type
    trestbps -> resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
    chol - > serum cholestoral in mg/dl
    fbs -> (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
    restecg -> resting electrocardiographic results
    thalach -> maximum heart rate achieved
    exang -> exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
    oldpeak -> ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
    slope -> the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
    ca -> number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
    thal -> 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
    target -> 1 or 0
